# FullStack Factoids - Python Trivia Code Samples

Welcome to the FullStack Factoids Python Trivia repository! Here, you'll find code samples corresponding to each trivia question from our YouTube channel. Each trivia question has its own dedicated file, making it easy for you to navigate and explore.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux.
- Internet connection (for installation).

## Python Installation

### Windows:

1. Visit the official [Python Downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version for Windows.
3. Run the installer. Ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked and then click "Install Now."

### macOS:

```bash
python3 --version
```
If not installed, you can use your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

## Running the Code Samples

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FullStackFactoids/python-trivia-code-samples.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:
```bash
cd python-trivia-code-samples
```

3. Run the desired trivia code sample:
```bash
